Trying to make this a habit.  I also downloaded a Jekyll Admin gem which should make creating posts a little easier as I learn markdown (post formatting) and some Jekyll syntax things (linking, embedding images).

Nothing too interesting to post about today.  I was too busy hanging out with my kid and family to ponder anything. 

Kids are weird though. Fun, frustrating, joyous, silly, and so many other adjectives. And it's only the beginning.
