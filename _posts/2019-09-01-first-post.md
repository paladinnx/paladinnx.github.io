This is the first post of the small potatoes blog. Not sure if I'll keep this going. Some topics will include music, video games, food, maybe some programming things-- just about anything to motivate me to be a little more expressive. Right now it is a way to learn some Jekyll, git, and get back to doing some kind of home project. 

I've wanted to have a blog again for a while and now I've finally made it happen. This isn't quite as fun as writing my own in PHP back in high school, but this is interesting too. There is a lot to configure and lot of missing parts of the blog that will eventually be filled in.
